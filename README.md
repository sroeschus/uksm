# uksm
The uksm were orginally maintained in [this](https://github.com/dolohow/uksm) repository.
However it looks like the most recent patch has been for 5.17.

I'm currently working at meta on improving KSM. I'm using the UKSM implementation to
compare it against KSM. I needed a more current implementation of UKSM to compare it
to KSM. I ported this UKSM patch to more current releases. If you use the patches,
please add some reference to this repository.
